# Hey there! I'm Faria Anowara Adhora 👋

I'm an electronics engineering student who gets excited about building things that move, think, and connect! Whether it's designing PCBs, programming microcontrollers, or working on robotics projects, I love bringing ideas to life.

## What I'm up to these days
Right now, I'm diving deep into IoT projects and intelligent machines while balancing my coursework. I'm lucky to be part of two amazing teams at CUET – working on electrical systems for our Mars Rover and avionics for the StarLap Rocket project. Both have taught me so much about real-world engineering challenges!

## Some things I've done
- Published research paper on PCF-Based SPR Sensors
- Designed custom PCBs for various projects
- Built several robotics and embedded systems projects

## What keeps me curious
I'm always learning something new – lately it's been about cross-border payment platforms and how to make robotics more intelligent. If it involves electronics, code, or making hardware do cool things, I'm probably interested!

## Let's connect!
I'm always up for collaborating on IoT, robotics, or embedded systems projects. If you're working on something interesting or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!

**Fun fact:** When I'm not tinkering with circuits or writing code, you'll find me trekking and exploring nature. There's something about being outdoors that refreshes my mind and brings new perspectives!
